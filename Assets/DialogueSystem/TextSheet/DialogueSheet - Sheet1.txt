Mother	Good morning, honey? Did you sleep well today?	I have left your bag at the table over there. Take it with you on your journey.	Before you leave, talk to your father. He has something important to tell you.		
Father	Good morning, son! I have something important to tell you.	There is a town nearby. Two close relatives of ours live there and they require something that we need,	Do your old man a favor and bring back some grains and vegetables for us.	Oh, and watch out for wandering spirits. Some of our villagers have never returned once they leave.	Good luck!
Spirit	Chief, I think we should devise a plan for the people of the village.	The high powers already have threatened and attack other villages, some even without warning. 	I think we should evacuate the people to a safer place.	True, but as you said, we are ill-prepared for the attack. I'd say some of our strongest men should stay behind and guard the village, allowing the women, children and other men leave safetly.	Chief! Where are these raining missiles coming from?!
Chief	Hmm... Lets discuss this matter at the temple.	Our village is clearly not prepared for what danger the high powers has in stored for us.	Makes sense. However, there is no safer place for us to go. And we don't know when the enemy will attack.	I believe that is best course of the action we can take. It looks we have no choice. Let's address this matter to the whole village.	Where else?! It seems the assault has already begun. I'm afraid that we're too late...
